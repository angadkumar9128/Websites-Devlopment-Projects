            <ol>
                <li>Fast and Reliable Performance: </li>
                <p>
                    Users expect online products to load quickly and respond promptly to their actions. Optimizing the
                    product's performance, reducing loading times, and minimizing downtime are critical to keep users
                    engaged and satisfied with the experience.
                </p>
                <li>Usability and User Experience: </li>
                <p>
                    For products to be successful, they need to be user-friendly and provide a positive user experience.
                    Whether it's a physical product with easy-to-use features or an online product with an intuitive
                    interface, usability and user experience play a significant role in customer satisfaction and
                    adoption.

                <li>Quality and Reliability:</li>
                <p>
                    Customers expect products to be of high quality and reliable. Quality involves meeting or exceeding
                    customer expectations, while reliability ensures that the product consistently performs its function
                    without failure or defects.
                </p>
                <li>Security and Privacy:</li>
                <p>
                    Online products must prioritize security and privacy to protect user data and transactions.
                    Implementing robust security measures, encryption, and following industry standards helps build
                    trust with users and ensures their sensitive information remains safe.
